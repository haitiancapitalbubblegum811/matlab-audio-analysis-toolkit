## 🚀 Getting Started

Welcome to the matlab-audio-analysis-toolkit! This is a MATLAB project designed for users who are interested in analyzing audio signals without needing technical expertise. With this toolkit, you can visualize waveforms, generate spectrograms, and apply digital filters to your audio files.

### 📦 What You Need

Before you get started, ensure that you have the following:

- A computer with MATLAB installed (R2018a or newer recommended)
- Basic knowledge of how to open and run scripts in MATLAB

### 🌟 Key Features

- **Waveform Plotting**: Easily visualize audio signals.
- **Spectrogram Generation**: See how frequencies change over time.
- **Digital Filtering**: Apply various filters for audio enhancement.

## 📥 Download & Install

To download and install the toolkit, follow these steps:

## 📄 How to Use the Toolkit

1. **Loading Audio Files**:
   - Use the function `loadAudio(filename)` to load your audio file into MATLAB. Replace `filename` with the path to your audio file.

2. **Plotting Waveforms**:
   - Call the function `plotWaveform(data)` where `data` is the audio signal loaded.
  
3. **Generating Spectrograms**:
   - Use `generateSpectrogram(data)` to visualize your audio’s frequency components over time.

4. **Applying Filters**:
   - Call `applyFilter(data, filterType)` to enhance your audio signal. You can choose from various filter types.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while using the toolkit:

1. Ensure that you have a compatible version of MATLAB installed.
2. Check for any dependencies that may need to be installed via MATLAB’s add-on manager.
3. Refer to the code comments for guidance or look for example scripts included in the toolkit.
